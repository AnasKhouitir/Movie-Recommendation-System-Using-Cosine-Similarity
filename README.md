Title: Movie Recommendation System Using Cosine Similarity

In this project, I developed a movie recommendation system that suggests films based on user preferences by leveraging cosine similarity. The system uses text-based features from movie descriptions and metadata to provide personalized recommendations.

Key Steps:
Data Preparation:

Imported and processed a dataset of movies, including attributes such as titles, genres, and descriptions using Pandas.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and readiness for analysis.
Text Feature Extraction:

Utilized TfidfVectorizer from Scikit-learn to convert movie descriptions into numerical feature vectors, capturing the importance of words while reducing dimensionality.
Cosine Similarity Calculation:

Computed the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of all movies. This metric quantifies the similarity between films based on their descriptions, enabling effective recommendations.
Recommendation Generation:

Implemented a function that, given a movie title, retrieves and ranks similar movies based on cosine similarity scores.
Developed an interactive user interface (if applicable) to allow users to input their favorite movies and receive tailored recommendations.
Results and Evaluation:

Analyzed the recommendations to ensure diversity and relevance, making adjustments to the model as necessary to enhance user satisfaction.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of cosine similarity in a movie recommendation system, providing users with personalized suggestions based on content similarities. It showcases how machine learning techniques can be employed to enhance user experiences in entertainment platforms.
